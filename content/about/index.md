Summary
--------
I specialize in leading large-scale data engineering initiatives and driving enterprise-wide data architecture transformations. My efforts have enabled scalable multi-petabyte platforms that support artificial intelligence applications and data-driven decision-making across global operations. I am passionate about enabling AI usage within the teams I manage to accelerate the delivery of solutions. 

My expertise includes designing and deploying robust data platforms using technologies such as Databricks Spark, Kubernetes, and Delta Lake, while advancing cost-efficient solutions, including Rust-based query engines. Committed to fostering innovation, I build global teams that deliver and empower analytics at scale.

I continually strive to expand my skill set. Currently, I am experimenting with Rust on the Solana blockchain and building WASM-powered sites using Dioxus.
